Note: When running through the command "npm i"

There was an error for my npm, the solution to get the package compiled, was found here -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66893199/hanging-stuck-reifyprettier-timing-reifynodenode-modules-nrwl-workspace-comp

I used 'npm install -g npm@6'

Followed by npm install 

And upgraded the packages, after deleting the lock file, 

ncu, 
ncu -u,
npm install
